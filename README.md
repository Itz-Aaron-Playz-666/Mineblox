# **App Name**: Mineblox Studio

## Core Features:

- Game Creation Studio: An in-game studio where players can build and design their own games using a Minecraft-like block system.
- Game Hosting Platform: Host player-created games, which can then be shared and played on the Mineblox website.
- Web-Based Game Player: Play the player created games directly within a web browser via a custom Mineblox website. Player created games can also be played on PC but website support should be the priority
- Avatar Customization: Players can customize their in-game avatar with various skins, accessories, and emotes.
- Game Discovery: Players can browse games by new, popular, or trending and other recommendation methods. Include robust searching and filtering options.
- Procedural Tool Suggester: A generative AI tool that suggests appropriate in-game building tools based on the user's design goals and creation history. For example, it could suggest tools to create more natural looking land scapes and objects. The reasoning abilities of the LLM would also provide explanations for why a suggested tool may be valuable to the builder, enabling it to act as a tutor or mentor. The AI tool would also make reasonable assumptions, when possible, like suggesting how the tool would need to be customized and tuned for a more appropriate use.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light blue (#A7D9ED), evoking a sense of openness, creativity, and the sky in Minecraft.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), almost white, creating a clean and unobtrusive backdrop.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#FFB347), used to highlight interactive elements and calls to action, adding a playful and inviting feel.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and short amounts of body text, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for longer passages.
- Use simple, blocky icons that match the visual style of Minecraft.
- Layout should be block-oriented in the same vein as the primary inspiration Minecraft, especially within the creator studio.
- Incorporate subtle animations, like blocks sliding into place or gentle fades, to add visual interest without being distracting.
